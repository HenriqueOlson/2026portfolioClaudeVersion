## Bringing Clarity Through Visual flows

I joined this ongoing project to design an approval flow feature. After reviewing previous meeting recordings, I noticed the team lacked clarity on the requirements. To address this, I created visual information architecture flows based on available documentation and used them to validate requirements with key stakeholders. This brought clarity to the team and established a solid foundation for the solution.

## Connecting User Journeys in Complex Approval Workflows

The goal was to enable clients to create personalized approval flows for different needs. The solution required four key elements: registering users, creating profiles with custom permissions, assigning users to profiles, and setting up approval flows with parameters.

Understanding the personas was crucial. The complexity of connecting different journeys revealed an important challenge - three main personas with complementary roles needed to interact seamlessly. This meant the solution also required a notification system tailored to each persona's journey.

## User research

To validate our assumptions, the Product Owner and I conducted usability testing with 9 operational users using prototypes. The research uncovered critical issues that needed resolution before launch.

**Key findings:**

Users expected payments and transfers to be separated, reflecting their daily workflow. We restructured the side navigation to accommodate this mental model.

A major pain point emerged during request reviews—missing context made approvals difficult. We added a description field to the existing request feature to provide necessary details.

Users instinctively looked to the center of the interface for their most frequent tasks, but no dashboard existed. As one participant noted: "It's always good to have a shortcut... it's important because it's a daily activity." This insight led us to design a centralized dashboard for core workflows.
