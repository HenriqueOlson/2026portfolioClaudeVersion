## The Challenge

Profile redesign was the first big challenge at Questrade. The current system was complex, with 11 screens and multiple user flows. The goal was to simplify the system and create a unified profile experience across web and mobile platforms.

The challenge was to create a mobile-first experience that would simplify the account management process while maintaining compliance with financial regulations and KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements.

## Design Actions

I focused on understanding the existing system architecture and identifying opportunities to consolidate flows. Working closely with engineering and compliance teams, I mapped out the critical user journeys and regulatory requirements.

Information architecture artifacts used during the project to validate logic and business rules.

## Solving Complexity

The key insight was that users don't think in terms of "accounts" and "profiles" - they think in terms of tasks they want to accomplish. By restructuring the information architecture around user goals rather than system structure, we were able to dramatically simplify the experience.

The new design consolidated multiple screens into a single, scrollable profile view with contextual editing. This approach reduced cognitive load and made it easier for users to find and update their information.
