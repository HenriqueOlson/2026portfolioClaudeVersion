## Challenge

My task was to design a mobile-native feature for profile using the existing legacy system as a reference. The Profile feature exists independently on Questrade's platforms, but once a year, customers are required to update their information, which follows this structure:

  alt="Profile update flow structure: 1. Warning - Entry point, 2. Review all data - Wizard, 3. Edit information - Profile feature"
  class="rounded-lg w-full my-8"
/>

While mapping the flow of all 17 profile questions [part 3], I discovered that several cases from the legacy were missing in the modernized web version, and lacking a documentation to reference.

## Action

I drove collaboration with the back-end team to understand the logic, validating my findings from testing the legacy system in order to create documentation to be used as a source. I also coordinated iterations for the modernized web version and handed off the mobile feature with the respective teams, ensuring an aligned experience that met legal and compliance requirements.

## Solving Complexity

One of the most complex questions to design was the pairing of Residential Address and Tax Residency, which had to be tied together to meet compliance requirements. When a client updates either information, they're prompted to update the corresponding one immediately. The edit only saves successfully if both fields match.

Three levels of navigation were necessary to ensure clear logic flow. This included pre-selecting the country in the residential address field when users changed their tax residency, or requesting specific tax information based on a previously selected country.
