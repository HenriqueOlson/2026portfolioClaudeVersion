## Stage One

An unmoderated user test with the current design was conducted to assess user behavior and uncover opportunities. This test was planned with 24 participants that answered where they would go to open a new account. A repeated behavior was analyzed: Participants were searching at the account selector dropdown, but not recognizing the "+" icon as the access point.

## Stage Two

Another unmoderated user testing with the concept one was conducted aiming to evaluate the solution proposed. Tested with 50 participants, the percentage of participants who clicked on the account selector access point also increased from 8.33% to 40%.

    </ul>

## Stage Three

While the first concept was being tested, a second concept was introduced for discussion with a subtly different positioning. An unmoderated A/B testing comparing the effectiveness between design concept one and two was conducted looking to make a decision based on performance.
